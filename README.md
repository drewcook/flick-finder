# Flick Finder

## About

Flick finder helps you find movies and TV shows that you may want to watch.  Users can create an account and keep track of movies or shows they would be interested in watching.  You can add or remove movies or shows to lists, favorite movies, or create custom lists for more organization.

For example, you can search for movies by genre, title, or the year it was released.  You can then add to the "Movies to watch" list or any other list you may have created.  You may also favorite movies individually.

### Develop

To run the application locally, run the following command: `npm run dev`.

The application will spin up on a local port.

### Demo
